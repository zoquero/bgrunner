# Summary

Tool written in C to launch and keep track of background processes

Angel Galindo ( zoquero@gmail.com ), January of 2017

# Features

It allows to launch multiple processes in background, keep track of them, wait for it's completion applying timeouts and get their stdout, stderr, return code and duration.

# Motivation

Basic \*NIX tools are too much basic:

* With ampersand (`&`) you can just launch one process and you have manage it by hand (`ps` and `kill` on a loop).
* `cron` and `at` allow you to run multiple background processes but you still have to manage them manually.
