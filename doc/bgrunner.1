bgrunner \- Background jobs runner
.SH SYNOPSIS
Background jobs runner

Usage:

bgrunner (-v) (-d) (-o outputfolder) -f <jobsdescriptor>

* -v == verbose

* -d == debug (more verbosity)

* -o => output folder with stdout, stderr, duration and job result code for each job. Defaults to /tmp

* -f => job descriptor, a CSV file like this:



#alias;startAfterMS;maxDurationMS;command

one;0;0;/tmp/myscript.sh

two;15000;10000;/usr/local/bin/myexecutable

three;5000;30000;/usr/local/bin/otherexecutable



fields for the descriptor:

* 1st: alias for the job

* 2nd: miliseconds to wait before executing the job

* 3rd: max duration for the job in miliseconds. After that it will be killed sending SIGKILL.

* 4th: path for the command to be executed. Parameters aren't allowed. As a workaround you can wrap them on a script.
